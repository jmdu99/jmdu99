# Hi there 👋, I'm Jose

**Freelance Data Engineer** — Turning messy data into clarity for projects with real impact.  
I work with purpose-driven teams to build data systems they can trust.

- ⚙️ Automate cleaning & validation for always-ready data  
- 🚀 Design efficient ETL/ELT pipelines (Airflow, dbt, Spark…)  
- 📈 Build solid foundations for BI, ML & GenAI  
- ⏱ Create real-time dataflows when speed matters  

## 💻 Tech Stack

## 🎯 About Me
Since 2021, I've worked in data across tech, banking, and large-scale systems (Amazon, Slido/Cisco).  
In 2025, I went freelance to focus on projects with real impact — from healthtech and edtech to any sector that values purpose as much as results.  
I also donate 10% of my earnings to the GiveWell Top Charities Fund.
